This is a collection of templated macros to create common data structures
storing a user-specified type. Each data structure is defined by two macros
in its own file. So to use, for example, a binary heap holding (void *), your
source should contain something like this:

	#include "binaryheap.h"

	typedef void * vaddr_t;

	DECLARE_BINARYHEAP(vaddr_t)
	DEFINE_BINARYHEAP(vaddr_t)

Currently, the templates do not like types with spaces (hence, the need for
the typedef). Additionally, templates that define a default comparison function
(e.g., binaryheap's _value_min_heap_condition) will not play well with embedded
complex types, so you will need to use a pointer to the type and define your
own comparison function accordingly.

Defining interfaces for the various types is beyond the scope of this README,
as, at the time of writing, there is currently only one type. Please see the
relevant header file for prototypes.
