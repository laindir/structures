NAME
	binaryheap, binaryheap_insert, binaryheap_delete - Functions operating on binary heaps

SYNOPSIS
	#include <binaryheap.h>

	struct binaryheap binaryheap(void **data, size_t size, size_t count, int (*heap_condition)(void *a, void *b));
	int binaryheap_insert(struct binaryheap *heap, void *item);
	void *binaryheap_delete(struct binaryheap *heap);

DESCRIPTION
	binaryheap() returns a struct binaryheap describing a binary heap of count
	items in data, with a maximum capacity of size. The members of this struct
	should not be accessed directly.

	binaryheap_insert adds an item to the heap and returns 0 if successful.

	binaryheap_delete removes item at the top of the heap and returns it.

RETURN VALUE
	binaryheap() returns a struct describing the heap.

	binaryheap_insert() returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise.

	binaryheap_delete() returns a pointer to the deleted item, NULL otherwise.
